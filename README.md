# Character-Gen-Project

Using the free QT license for LGPLv3 (Lesser General Public License v. 3) https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/lgpl.html

By taking in key-value pairs, it will randomly generate a Character based on values YOU define.

My attempt to create a character generator app with UI using C++ and QT.

The build v1.0 is for windows only at the moment.
